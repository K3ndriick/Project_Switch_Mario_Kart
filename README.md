# Acknowledgments

We are part of the **Monash Assistive Tech Team**, working on [**Project Switch**](https://www.monatt.org/project-switch) ‚Äî a not-for-profit university student organization project. Our mission and goal is to develop a low-cost, highly customizable **Nintendo Switch Controller** to support underprivileged individuals and gamers with physical disabilities.

### Contributions

This project builds on the work of the following repositories:

- [**CrazyRedMachine's LUFAHybridFightstick**](https://github.com/CrazyRedMachine/LUFAHybridFightstick) - *(We modified the `main.ino` files to develop an assistive single-handed controller for the Nintendo Switch.)*  
- [**fluffymadness' ATMega32U4-Switch-Fightstick**](https://github.com/fluffymadness/ATMega32U4-Switch-Fightstick)
- [**bootsector's XInputPadMicro**](https://github.com/bootsector/XInputPadMicro)

We deeply appreciate the contributions from all these developers and contributors, whose work made our project possible! :smile:

## Switch Fightstick Code (Atmega32U4)

This one is a working switch fightstick sketch
flashable via Arduino IDE. I personally use it on a pro micro clone microcontroller that can be bought for 2-3$ on aliexpress. My motivation was to have a working solution for dirt-cheap easy source-able parts. Well here it is. 

The Code itself has proper Button-Debounce, and 3 Modes of input.

You can switch seamlessly between the 3 modes by pressing START+SELECT. 

- Digital Only
- Fake Analog (Digital Movement is mapped to L-Analog)
- Smash Ultimate Mode (Most-left button on the second row of a fight stick is used as a modifier key to decrease the range of the Analog stick, if held)

## Building Instructions

- Download Arduino IDE, 

- Download the Bounce2 Library inside the Arduino IDE
- Download Arduino Lufa from https://github.com/Palatis/Arduino-Lufa and follow the instructions on it's repository
- Build and Flash for your ATMEGA32U4 Board
- Have Fun

## Pinmapping
