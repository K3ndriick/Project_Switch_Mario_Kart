# Acknowledgments

We are part of the **Monash Assistive Tech Team**, working on [**Project Switch**](https://www.monatt.org/project-switch) ‚Äî a not-for-profit university student organization project. Our mission and goal is to develop a low-cost, highly customizable **Nintendo Switch Controller** to support underprivileged individuals and gamers with physical disabilities.

## Contributions

This project builds on the work of the following repositories:

- [**CrazyRedMachine's LUFAHybridFightstick**](https://github.com/CrazyRedMachine/LUFAHybridFightstick) - *(We modified the `main.ino` files to develop an assistive single-handed controller for the Nintendo Switch and forced it to be in Switch mode at all times)*  
- [**fluffymadness' ATMega32U4-Switch-Fightstick**](https://github.com/fluffymadness/ATMega32U4-Switch-Fightstick)
- [**bootsector's XInputPadMicro**](https://github.com/bootsector/XInputPadMicro)

We deeply appreciate the contributions from all these developers and contributors, whose work made our project possible! :smile:
